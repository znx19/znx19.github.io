Work experience
======
* Spring 2023 - Summer 2024, University of Chicago: Research Assistant
  * Project: Multi-Dimensional Information with Specialized Lenders
  * Supervisor: Zhiguo He, Jing Huang, Cecilia Parlatore
    *Systematically reviewed and further adapted the credit market competition model with asymmetric information to elucidate the observed interest rate disparity among banks with specializations in diverse degrees.
    *Executed a rigorous comparative static analysis on key parameters through numerical calculastions, employing parallel computation techniques in Matlab.

* Fall 2022 - Summer 2023, University of Chicago: Research Assistant
  * Project: Consumer-Financed Fiscal Stimulus: Evidence from Digital Coupons in China
  * Supervisor: Jing Ding, Lei Jiang, Lucy Msall, Matthew J. Notowidigdo
    * Developed mathematical proofs delineating properties of Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) and maximized utility based on a consumption model on digital coupons, with a second-order estimation.
    * Evaluated the efficacy of coupons versus linear tax (subsidy) and cash subsidy in stimulating temporary consumption both theoretically and numerically, based on an extended model with a social planner.
    * Employed statistical testing, utilizing the permutation method in R, to assess the significance of MPCs.

* Fall 2022 - Summer 2023, University of Chicago: Research Assistant
  * Project: Non-Tariff Trade Barriers in the U.S.-China Trade War
  * Supervisor: Tuo Chen, Chang-Tai Hsieh, Zheng (Michael) Song
