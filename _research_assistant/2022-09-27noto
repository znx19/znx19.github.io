excerpt: 'Developed mathematical proofs delineating properties of Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) and maximized utility based on a consumption model on digital coupons, with a second-order estimation.
    * Evaluated the efficacy of coupons versus linear tax (subsidy) and cash subsidy in stimulating temporary consumption both theoretically and numerically, based on an extended model with a social planner.
    * Employed statistical testing, utilizing the permutation method in R, to assess the significance of MPCs.'
